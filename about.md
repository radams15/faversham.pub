# About

Welcome to our humble blog, a tribute to the fine public houses of Faversham and its proud brewing heritage. Nestled in the heart of Kent, this historic market town is home to a splendid array of traditional inns and taverns, steeped in history and charm. Central to Faversham’s identity is Shepherd Neame, Britain’s oldest brewer, which has been crafting fine ales here since 1698.

Faversham is like a well-poured pint of Kentish ale—rich with history, full of character, and best enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The cobbled streets are the frothy head, brimming with stories from centuries past, while the town itself is a deep, amber-hued brew, layered with the flavors of old-world charm, maritime grit, and a touch of eccentricity. And just like any good pub, it’s got its regulars, its hidden gems, and the occasional lively debate over which watering hole serves the best pint.

Our blog seeks to celebrate this legacy by exploring and reviewing each of Faversham’s pubs. We delve into their unique stories, uncovering the characters, pints, and atmosphere that make them so special. Whether you’re drawn by the history, the hospitality, or simply the quest for the perfect pint, join us as we raise a glass to the best of Faversham’s pubs and the enduring spirit of Shepherd Neame!
