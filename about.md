# About

Welcome to our humble blog, a tribute to the fine public houses of Faversham and its proud brewing heritage. Nestled in the heart of Kent, this historic market town is home to a splendid array of traditional inns and taverns, steeped in history and charm. Central to Faversham’s identity is Shepherd Neame, Britain’s oldest brewer, which has been crafting fine ales here since 1698.

Our blog seeks to celebrate this legacy by exploring and reviewing each of Faversham’s pubs. We delve into their unique stories, uncovering the characters, pints, and atmosphere that make them so special. Whether you’re drawn by the history, the hospitality, or simply the quest for the perfect pint, join us as we raise a glass to the best of Faversham’s pubs and the enduring spirit of Shepherd Neame!
