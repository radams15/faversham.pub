## The Pub

![Outside View](/assets/images/albion_taverna_2.small.jpg)

The Albion Taverna is a pub which has a promising name - literally meaning
the tavern of Britain. It is one of the further pubs from Faversham high street,
but not too much of a trek.

We visited around 2:30pm, and since it's winter the sun was already starting to
set. We still decided to sit down outside in order to see the Standard Quay, even
though at this time of year it looks a bit of a mess...

The atmosphere in the pub is more restaurant-like than pub-like, which isn't to
say it's bad, however it's not quite the experience one hopes for when going
to a pub.

## Drinks

I had a Kentish Pip craftsman cider - it was decent, but did cost me almost £6,
a bit steep for today.

My friend had a Christmas Ale - he said it was very good, although had far too
much sediment, as you can see below. His pint set him back a more standard £5.

## Food

We didn't try the food in the Taverna, since the cheapest main available was £17.
This put us off ordering, although it did smell delicious! They serve mainly
Mexican food and have quite good reviews from others.

Overall, the Albion Taverna is a fairly standard Shepherd Neame pub - slightly
expensive drinks, not a massive amount of character, but with some brilliant
drinks available, mostly brewed locally. The worst part however of the visit:
when returning our glasses and thanking the barman, I was ignored!
