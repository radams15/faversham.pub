Ah the Old Wine Vaults, one of the most... interesting pubs in Faversham. In the daytime it is almost empty, while at nights it is a very rowdy place indeed.

We arrived at the wine vaults around midday, sitting outside. We believed we were only the second group of clients there - but that soon changed after we realised that the other people there were either friends of the landlord or contractors on a break. After 15 minutes or so at our table we noticed the landlord had come to speak to the others about something, before all of them headed up a ladder into the loft area of the pub and stayed there for the remaining 30 minutes of our stay. This was a very peculiar sight.

The garden area of the Wine Vaults where we were seated definitely had character. The tables are covered in avian excrement, and the ground littered with old plastic bottles, rubbish and worse.

At one point we were greeted by a rat running past us upon the wall, but he didn't stop for a chat, probably aware that anyone who frequents the wine vaults would probably bite its head off without a second though.

Like any good pub, the wine vaults does not serve food, only liquid refreshments. Talking of liquids, one of the only positives for the pub is the price of a pint. It cost just under 2 pounds for a Strongbow - which in this day and age is almost unheard of, even in Wetherspoons.

Later that day, we returned for an evening of karaoke - a night where one can see who people really are. The good people of Faversham seemed to be having a good evening in the pub, obviously too drunk to care about the shortcomings of the pub. The music choice was acceptable but I would rate the karaoke singers a 4/10 as they were all quite out of tune. The pints were still the same price as before, and there was no cost to take up the microphone.


Overall, I'd rate this pub a 6/10, as compared to other Faverpubs it lacks character, feels slightly unwelcoming with its borderline feral clientele, and is quite dirty inside and out. But the pints being so cheap means that this is most likely not the last time we visit the Old Wine Vaults.
