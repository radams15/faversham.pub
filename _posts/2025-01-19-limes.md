The Limes is one of the most frequented pubs for us in Faversham, the standard
and the default. Whenever we go to Faversham, we always start at the Limes.
It seems fitting then that one of the first reviews on this site is about it.

## The Pub

The Limes is situated just past the railway station at Faversham, as you make
your way down the high street. The exterior is friendly enough, and walking
through the front door one is greeted by a clean and open bar area.

Upon purchasing a drink, you can either sit at some small 2-person tables
beside the bar, or walk back behind the bar to some very comfy armchairs next
to a fireplace. We very rarely see the fire alight unfortunately - this would
greatly improve the experience.

Further back from the armchairs are a large circular table - great for groups of
friends having a pub crawl, as should be done when visiting Faversham. Past this
lies a fairly average beer garden.

The interior is fairly nice, however there are very few interesting wares
on the walls - they are rather plain but overall nice enough.

## Food and Drink

Standard for a Neame pub, there was Orchard View on tap for the cider option.
It's an OK cider, but a bit too carbonated and slightly too acidic for my tastes.
Jack had a Guinness as usual, and that requires no comment.

We haven't ever seen food being served, but we've been assured that they do in
fact serve food. This of course means I cannot comment on their food selection.

## Conclusions

Overall The Limes is another standard Neame pub - although the interior is nice
enough and the drinks are OK, there is nothing massively special about the pub.

I'm giving it a 7/10 as I have very few faults with it, but I simply feel it
could be so much more if it had something unique to boast.

## Location and Interior

The Limes, a very odd name. Where are the Limes? Certainly not in the UK, at least not naturally. One would be mistaken for thinking the name forbodes inside a tropical nightmare, or perhaps, cynically, something bought here from foreign soil. However, this allegory is thankfully in jest, fear not, the soul is pleasantly warmed to find inside a wholesome classic Anglo pub. The bar, like many things, is open and wide, allowing staff to easily socialise with patrons and indulge deeper in the talk of the town. Seating is above average, leather armchairs ‘hide’ to the rear of the bar providing supreme comfort for the working Faverman, these cows did not die in vain. Along to the side there are multiple booths and a larger dining room, whilst terribly modern, this tumour has luckily not yet metastasised, and the majority remains pure. The location is very close to the train station, and on many occasions, one has had a quick pint before dashing for the train, although this I would advise against. Whilst the interior does lack anything unique, it is unapologetically classically average and worth some time. Nobody would feel particularly disappointed or invigorated by coming here, it’s a safe pair of hands.

## Drinks

Available is the usual selection for a Neame pub. Whilst very average and unremarkable, the brewery does produce good beers such as the Double Stout. Unfortunately declining in popularity due to the liberalisation of the tastebuds, the drink fortunately remains stalwart here. Although practisers of Neameology must pay heed. On occasion the barman has been known to only accept a voucher for Neame drinks, which excludes Guinness. This is a shadow of the darkest hue and will always remain in my mind, like those who tried to steal from me in Mayfair last November. I did not try the cider as I personally do not dabble with the deviants.

## Food

Whilst I did not consume here, the menu seemed Faveraverage in terms of selection and price. I have little to comment on this.

## Summary

The Limes makes me think of the restaurant chain Côte, somewhere consistently average where money is well spent. Whilst lacking the perennial spirit, one must consider the joys of the normative. It is certainly true there are rooms for improvement in making this truly a landmark, but one contemplates that this normality isn’t actually that bad. In pursuing the exceptional, there is always the risk of falling below the normal. There is merit in a contented baseline and this is important. I would advise patrons to stop for two pints if they are using the station. This would set you up well for travels towards the hub of commerce known as Selling. Keep in mind the Lime, quite oxymoronic in its name, an exotic fruit but a very classically average pub. This is like a trip to Norwich. I rate this a 6.5. This sets a good mark for a traditional pub and harks a hymn to the silent majority whilst setting the ground for the mediocrity versus excellence showdown of pubs to come.
