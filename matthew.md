## Matthew 'Half-Pint' McFarnell

On many occasions during pub crawls, Matthew has nothing to drink because he
is scared of his drunken self. If in a good mood, Matthew can sometimes, be seen
drinking a half pint!

Ah, so here we have both Matthew and Rhys. This was taken at a great local pub, the Bell Inn, at Saint Nicholas-at-Wade. As one would expect from a thoroughbred ecclesiastical name, the village was exceptional. Now, on to the issue at hand, Mr Matthew. Sporting his classic black quarter-zip, bought by his mother, he sits contemplating his half pint. Due to having drunk one two hours prior, Matthew is concerned consuming this will turn him a raging drunkard, or give him spontaneous crippling depression, as had happened in the past. Still, he must be commended; few men could order this feeling no shame. One could speculate him putting this next to Rhysâ€™ full pint is very representative of the equipment he carries. With an air of submission Matthew looks down, perhaps in disappointment that the pub is not a Wetherspoons, or, on a more sombre note, regretting his current company. For if these were to be his friends in Sheffield, he would be sure to buy an extravagant meal and cater to their every need, a luxury that is not extended to his heterosexual friends in Kent. He chooses not to consume here, the decent food not meeting his very realistic standard of being premium and cheap. Instead, like a seagull, he watches over his friends and asks for their pity chips.
